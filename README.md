🧠 How the Game Works
Monsters spawn randomly from the edges of the screen and follow the player.

You must shoot and eliminate them before they reduce your health.

Clearing each level by reaching a score threshold unlocks the next level with faster monsters.

Health hits zero? It's game over — but you can restart and try again!
